destroyer of evil be well disposed towards us mabry hospitai and share our welfare home peace peace peace sit so this is a peace chance you know in before studying any of the Upanishads we need to have a really usually have a peace chant come come good those are sitting could you just go back a little shift shifted a little bit so that other others who come can sit all right yeah come closer all right so the Mundaka Upanishad belongs to the Iturbide nevada you know we have four Vedas ancient Hindu scriptures the Rig Veda the yajurveda the sama Veda and the Iturbide Nevada and the different operations are scattered among these Vedas so the Mundaka Upanishad belongs to the atharva Nevada and this but particular Raiders have their particular peace chance so this particular piece chant which we just read which we will chant before every class is from the atharva Nevada and it is associated with each of the Upanishads of the Iturbide Nevada so for example the mandu key open Ishod another Upanishad from the atharva Nevada is the Mundaka Upanishad or depression open Ishod these are all Upanishads from the Iturbide Nevada now it's not there it should be there let me see the book you can't have the book will be fault if it starts without the peace chant it's the Sanskrit is missing which is a big lacuna that is interesting if anybody else wants to cut other copies left okay yeah you need to okay three mmm-hmm every book should have it yes yeah and we will we'll give you a photocopy later on they must have overlooked it yes that's interesting no it isn't all right we'll photocopy it and distribute it next time also one more thing we need to have is an English transliteration of the Sanskrit text for those who cannot read the Devanagari the Sanskrit we need to have an English translation it's available I think you can look look we can look it up in the internet and see if we can get a transliteration just the original text the open Ishod and dakari cos all right the Upanishads are many number in fact we find an account that I mean a very interesting story about Rama and Hanuman where Hanuman asks Rama how do I get moksha liberation and Rama says to him read the Manduca literally actually he says that there are these Upanishads and he gives a list of a hundred and eight Upanishads so we have a a hundred and eight opening shots which are available we hear of many more opening shots which have been lost over time but 108 of them are authentically available and you find a list in in that place in the my thing it's in the Mukti Kapoor nation where Rama Chandra gives a list of 108 upanishads but there he says Manduca Makem even mo moksha Namba Mukti for the for those who are seeking moksha liberation the Mundaka Upanishad by itself is sufficient if you study that that's it you will get liberation if you don't then you study the 10 main open issues the ten main or major opening shots are the ones on which Shankar Acharya wrote commentaries so basically vedanta abdul eight of Addante is based on the ten main open issues all the Upanishads of course but basically the ten main open issues and they come into these of Shankar Acharya and those so what are the ten main opening shots in to remember the names of the ten major Upanishads in Uttarakhand I mean Himalayas the monks have a little verse it goes like this ishikane Akata prashna mondo mondo katha teary he hated am cha chaan dog IAM we had our own Yocum tata it goes like this he open assured Cain open assured katha upanishad ishikane Akata Russian open assured then Mundaka Upanishad Mundaka Upanishad the one which are going to study then the ITA open assured at itd Upanishad the chandogya upanishad and the brihadaranyaka upanishad ten of these opposition's Shankar Acharya selected these ten to write commentaries shush in Sanskrit on these open ishod's and that became the basis of what we call modern Advaita Vedanta this he did about twelve hundred years ago there is one more opening shot the Shweta shutter open Ishod Wair Shankar Acharya wrote a commentary but it is a little of doubtful provenance because scholars doubt whether the original Shankar Acharya wrote the commentary you know there have been many Shankar Acharya Shankar Acharya sand and the heads of the for much as before monasteries established by Shankar Acharya four corners of India the heads are also called Shankar Acharya and many of them wrote many wonderful texts sometimes it just goes by the name Shankar Acharya so 10 without any doubt so the idea is study the Upanishads study demand ok open assured and get illumination and if you do not get illumination by that then you are welcome to study there at the 10 opening shots the other 9 if you do not get illumination Ramachandra goes on to say there are 32 or phoenicians and if that doesn't work for you there is the whole list of 108 108 upanishads which you can study now the Mundaka Upanishad he is also interestingly the not only the most powerful of of all of them it's also the smallest it has only 12 mantras 12 mantras so you might think that if it's the smallest and it's the most powerful and it's enough for illumination so why don't you start with that why is it considered difficult or you see it's it's extraordinarily concentrated I mean the wisdom Advaitic teaching is packed into it and a little familiarity with Advaita is required before you can touch this it's like a livewire in India they in Bengali they said honey Lanka little like a the peppers of the hot pepper little it's very little but it's very hot so in the same way this and this open ition is very little but it's very hot we already have familiarity many of us here have been with Vedanta with for years and years and in the recent past over the last year we have studied parts of the pancetta she we have studied the trig ratio Vivica and we have been listening to upper Oksana booty classes and standalone lectures on Vedanta so I think we are ready and even if we are not here we go it will be an exciting journey so stay with us on this journey I will be teaching Mundaka Upanishad with the caracas here and what the caracas are are I will explain and hopefully yes by the end of the journey are somewhere in between we will get illumined or if not at entire ly enlightened at least we'll have a better grasp on Advaita than when we started off so that's the goal now we Mundaka Upanishad as I said it has 12 verses or 12 mantras mandu Kea Upanishad it has 12 mantras these Upanishads we're the discoveries let's say of Rishi's sages who are at the very Fountainhead of the Vedic tradition and in super conscious states they discovered spiritual truths which they poured forth in poetic Vedic Sanskrit so legend goes that at the source of Mundaka Upanishad there was somebody called Manduca rishi now it might be a colorful story it because we don't know anything else really about this Manduca rishi other than that the name matches Manduca so it just might be a kind of back calculation the opposition is called Manduca so the the Rishi who thought it must be called Manduca when you derive the name Manduca from Manduca Manduca also means frog so in in in in Sanskrit so maybe it's the wisdom of a frog who knows and so that's shouted in mystery but what is not mysterious is by the way the Upanishads were all given by Rishi's by sages who experienced these truths and and gave it out in this poetic forms but it has been transmitted afterwards these Rishi's were householders they were invariably they were married their disciples later on it has been transmitted by a monastic tradition so the man Dukie open assured it has been commented on by go departure Lia go departure Lia goda father was Shankar Acharya screws guru so we are going beyond Shankar Acharya here most of the text we study were written by Shankar Acharya or the commentaries of Shankar Acharya or by the disciples of Shankar Acharya go to father was the Guru Guru of Govinda pada and Govinda father was the Guru of Shankar Acharya and Shankar Acharya sciples all the way down to three Saito de Pury who was the Guru of Sri Ramakrishna and so we are the followers of Sri Ramakrishna so that's an unbroken line we can trace it back historically at least up to go Rapada acharya there are names of gurus before gold apothecary also but they are mythological they do you find their names in Puranas in in in myth you cannot locate them in history exactly so for example Gorda padas guru was supposed to be sukadeva so who's basically from from from sh-sh from from the Puranas yes you find the names in or ancient scriptures you want to put it there all right thank you now go Rapada is associated with the man dukhia because he took this open Ishod and wrote two hundred and fifteen verses commenting on these twelve mantras two hundred fifteen verses called carica carry kazar verses so go to father wrote 215 caracals on the twelve mantras hence now you have a text which is 227 verses it has become a tradition to study the open issue along with the caracas so when you study the open issued you study the twelve mantras of the open ocean and the 215 caracas altogether which is what we shall do on all of these the 12-month res and the 215 caracas Shankar Acharya in between remember there was Govinda powder Shankar Acharya he wrote a commentary called AB Hashem so the open issue this is the open Ishod these are the caracals and this is the Vashem this is what you find in your book the commentary of Shankar Acharya if you open your book and you will see the English translation of the commentary you sees Shankar Acharya scum and treat it in between there will be the Upanishad there will be the verses of God our Father and in English translation in that book you will find the commentary of Shankar Acharya what we are going to study we will study at this level the open ischl of course and the caracals which the commentary of Shankar Acharya I will refer to it quite often but I'm not going to teach it line by line I'm going to use it to teach but they are not going to go into the commentary directly because then you tend to get bogged down I want first of all to get this straight gets go straight to the heart of the opening shot with the dakari cos these carry cos are organized in four chapters called precarious fool precarious four chapters and the chapters are our gamma I'll tell you why they're called that are gamma proc arena the white e'terica Rena adwaita proc arena and a lot Ashanti / Corina four chapters the first chapter is called a gamma proc arena or the argument after argument literally means the vedas was one name for the vedas is a gaba so because so why is the first chapter called a gamma because the first chapter includes the Upanishad the amanda open each of the 12 verses that little open ition is in the first chapter it is embedded in the first chapter and in the first chapter are a few kali cos there are few caracas along with the 12 mantras so the 12 mantras the entire Roop initial plus a few verses of of gold upon comprise the first chapter called e R gamma proc arena which we are going to start yes versus literally means vs. yes God up the the 12 mantras of the original Upanishad which we will study of course and explanations and comments on them in the form of poetry poetic verses written by go deposit area and there are comments in sanskrit on both of them the Upanishad and the car because by Shankar Acharya so Shankar Acharya treats Takara cos at the level of the Upanishads because he takes them together and writes commentaries but these characters are yes they are explanations there are always explanations of these mantras now the first chapter contains the Upanishad and dakari cos and only the first chapter contains the Upanishads the other chapters because the first chapter contains the Upanishads it's called the are gamma the Vedic portion you know the opposition is a part of the Veda so it's a Vedic portion the other three chapters contain only the Caritas the remaining Caracas are in the other three chapters the open Ischl itself is is is finished it is completed in the first chapter itself so what are the other three chapters about the second chapter white Athiya karana that is the chapter on Fall City it's not a false chapter it's a chapter on the falsity of the world appearance why Tutera literally means not thus we Tata means not thus what it appears - it's not what it appears to be so the second chapter uses only logic and experience no reference to scriptural authority just logic and experience to show you using sheer logic based upon our experience that the world is this world making world the experience is no more real than our dreams so that's a very interesting chapter ii chapter now third chapter is the same logic can be might be used to prove that even non-duality Advaita is also not real so third chapter is to show that Advaita is real non duality is real the world of duality which we experience is false this is the purpose of the second chapter to demonstrate that based on logic and the third chapter again based on logic and based on our experience and reasoning is to show that non duality is real it is to explain non duality on the basis of a reasoning and there are many many other schools by some accounting 34 different philosophical schools which have been taken up at different points in the fourth chapter a lot ashanti the word a lotta shanti requires explanation it literally translates as quenching of the firebrand alotta means it's a Buddhist expression a firebrand if it is whirled around it looks like a circle so in it there is no circle there it's just one dot of fire being whirled around so that was an expression used by the Buddhists to show why the world seems to be continuous it's actually a continuous stream of consciousness so that's where the word a lot of a lotta chakra came so it's a derivation from that a lot of shanti prokhor and quenching the world of the firebrand but basically what what goes on in the fourth chapter is many different points of view are taken up and they are they are shown to be not right or not correct compared to the non dualist point of view so this is the Manduca Upanishad and the Manduca carica you can just call it the mandu Kakariko the moment you call it Manduca recommand if your position is included within it okay now what does the what does it teach we are going to start the first one the the agama prac arena goda pada Shankar Acharya zuru suru the name fathers just means it's an honorific I mean it just means a revered person a revered sir so Shankar Acharya himself would be called Shankar Acharya Bhagavad pada so the pala just means revered sir goda refers to Bengal actually so goda pada would probably have been somebody from mingle in very long ago about 1300 or 1400 years ago go refers to the northern part of Bengal okay now let's go to the first chapter a gamma Pro Kareena all of Vedanta basically tells us that that our I this limited I I which is it seems to be completely associated with this body and mind is actually an undivided infinite I it's this limitation which is the cause of sorrow is the cause of unhappiness limitation means I think I'm limited to this body and hence I'm limited by birth by ageing by disease and death I am limited to this particular mind so my knowledge is limited my thoughts are we I am subject to anxiety and despair all sorts of and desire and greed and all sorts of problems so these limitations of the eye that I have rooted I have trapped myself in this body mind complex this is the source of all our problems and Vedanta insists that we are making a huge mistake this eye is not limited it's actually an unlimited eye which we have limited by covering it up and trapping it within the prison of a body mind complex a body mind identity and what Vedanta intends to do is to point out to you your own infinite undivided nature which exists just now which exists right here which exists effortlessly without any kind of effort it does not require lots of meditation to become infinite it does not require lots of devotion to become infinite I mean suppose you are I am Here I am I think I'm server pre Ananda how much meditation does it require for me to realize I'm server pre Ananda nothing I know I'm sorry pre Ananda how much singing and dancing and devotion and rituals does it require for me to become self appear nothing you think I'm crazy if I'm doing a big puja for what to become Selva pre-owned under Swami you already are syrupy Anand you don't have to worry about it so now now one has to be careful here what one requires come does one need Vedanta to become Brahman no not even Vedanta you don't even need the Manduca class to become become infinite then why are we here why are we here we are here because the claim that I am an infinite I not a limited I this claim it's just a claim to us it does not seem like that to us Vedanta says we are suffering from ignorant about ourselves that bears repetition we are suffering from ignorant about ourselves we do not know ourselves as we truly are Vivekananda would often say in this country with a touch of pathos if only you knew yourselves as you truly are so we do not know ourselves as we truly are as this infinite I and Vedanta just points this out to us the approach that Vedanta takes is gently again and again in many different ways pointing it out to us the truth in the hope with the prayer that we will notice the moment you notice the work is done because what you are expected to notice is already there and once you notice it the work is done you know it for it's yours forever so the hope is that as we study demand occur it will suddenly dawn upon us what they are talking about that's the approach of a of of bread on that specially Mundaka Upanishad a man who kept open assured as I said it's very concentrated why is it concentrated see the Mundaka Upanishad is about all will spill soon soon see what I mean what what is ohm and what is what's it about but if you go to cut open t-shirt for example another of the upanishads very popular position the story of the little boy Nikita who went to the house of death to Yama's house there you find the story of Nikita how nachiketa goes to Emma's house and how Yama gives him three boons and what are the boons that magic a tasks and how Yama and and then educator finally prays for the ultimate knowledge the knowledge of the self and Yama says first tempts him the temptation of Nikita and magic kaito overcomes those temptations and finally Yama reveals to him what you've been asked finally quite a long way into the open Ishod what you've been asking for dear boy is this one mantra own and proceeds to explain a little bit that's in the cut rope initial and tight Terry open assured you find the glory of ohm in many places in dopes initials and this mondo key open assured the first mantra which we will study today it starts off with home this opening shot is just about ohm nothing else now so that's how I am saying is this opening shot is concentrated Brahma with the our Atma Vidya the knowledge of Brahman or the knowledge of the self it's it's heavily packed into it nothing is wasted I mean sometimes you feel they could have given a little more it's it's so terse and straight now the essential teaching of Vedanta is that you are that infinite reality that infinite eye you are existence consciousness bliss you are an infinite existence and infinite consciousness and infinite bliss not three things in one it's just one thing which is infinite existence consciousness bliss so this infinite existence consciousness bliss sat-chit-ananda and a name for this is Brahman in the open e shirts you find the name Brahman Brahman means the vast the vast that which has no limit no limit of what no limit of existence you are an immortal existence no limit of consciousness you are an infinite consciousness and infinite place so this Brahman and this Brahman is also the Upanishads see Atman the self I just said our real eye is an infinite eye art 1 means the self Brahman literally means the vast or infinite an adman means the self in fact Brahman is equal to Atman the vast is the self or the self is infinite this is basically the teaching of the Upanishads all the Upanishads all made anta finally boils down to this teaching that yourself you the real self is Brahman the infinite and this is expressed in the maha vaakya sleep profound sentences when the Vedanta is is beautifully taught in these profound sentences taught to am I see that thou art there are four of them conventionally there are four of them most famously that thou art taught to am I see that you find in the chandogya upanishad another one is a humbling has me I am Brahman don't worry you two are Brahman them when I say I'm from your Brahman so I am Brahman ah hum Rahm has me another one is that is found in the breelan a cop initial another one is bragging on Brahma this very individual consciousness the consciousness we find within ourselves is the infinite consciousness that you find in the ITT open assured Rig Veda am brahmasmi brethren accompany shoddy Vader taught Thomas each hand okay open Ishod samaveda that leaves only the Iturbide Nevada and yes it is in this Upanishad the one which are going to study the forth of these great sentences is found will study that the forth sentences I am Atma Brahma this very Atman is from literally this equation I am Atma I am in this this very self is Brahman I am Atma Brahma because of Sanskrit grammar atman and brahman and become Atma and Brahma this this is this sentence this great sentence maha vaakya is found in the Mundaka Upanishad which we will study literally the individual self and the absolute are one and the same thing now notice that this in finding to Advaita Vedanta this infinite such hidden under is what appears as this world this world when it's when Vedanta says world is false what it means is the world is nothing other than Brahman appearing in this way you could say the world is true also but the world is true only in the sense of Brahman Brahman alone existence consciousness place appears as this world we don't recognize Brahman here we just recognize our world things and places and people and animals and even sand space and time and matter and energy this is what we recognize but in reality Vedanta claims it is nothing other than such Iran and so this everything here what we experience all our lives is nothing other than satchitananda and this such a downunder exactly it's what is what is called Brahman and without the claims brown man is nothing other than you the self so a very interesting thing is that if you inquire into the self if you inquire into the self you will realize the true self which you equal to realizing Brahman which is equal to realizing the truth about everything I'll repeat again an inquiry into the self ez is equivalent to an inquiry into Brahman is equivalent to an inquiry into everything in the universe everything an enquiry leads to what knowledge any enquiry leads to knowledge you make an enquiry about plants and you will get botany so in the same way an inquiry into the entire universe to know the truth of the universe is equal to an inquiry into Brahman is equal to an inquiry into yourself Atman Serova vichara is equal to brahma vihara is equal to automobile Chara what this Upanishad does is mandoke Upanishad it has it's an inquiry into yourself it's an inquiry into ourselves but the result will be we will not only know ourselves but we will know ourselves as Brahman and by extension we will know the reality of the universe don't get me wrong it when I say you will know the reality of everything you'll know everything by this open Ishod I don't mean that you'll be transformed into Encyclopedia Brittanica know-it-alls know what you will know is the reality of everything that everything is Brahman that much if you want to know anything more than you have to go to the library and find out for the details but the reality of everything is known once you know once you know Brahman once you know Brahman once you know the self as it is start here one more point this is the path of knowledge the path of knowledge you have to hear this Sanskrit Shyvana you have to listen to this carefully come to the Upanishad listen to it get clarity and conviction that is Shravana and if all doubts have to be removed by thinking and asking questions and monana remove all doubts clarity and conviction and finally once you've got clarity and conviction bear down upon that clear and what you are clear about and convinced about and make it into a living reality by meditation man monana needed the asana in sanskrit shyvana hearing mononym that is thinking reflection needed the asana just a fancy word for Dhyana meditation hearing what this one in fact the word Upanishad itself if you derive it Shankar Acharya derives it to mean Upanishad oopah plus nee plus at Upanishads oopah plus knee + shot that's how you derive the word oopah literally means going near going near going near what going near the text and the teacher the open the open issued text and the teacher that is approaching it approaching it you listen to the teachings and nee means nice cherina getting clarity and conviction getting clarity and conviction and sutt has three meanings actually which are Onaga t avasara donna it loosens your bondage of suffering such which are no means to loosen loosen vision actually means destroys it destroys ignorance and makes you realize what you truly are and our sadhana means it loosens the bondage of suffering and the third meaning gutti means it takes you to Brahman it takes the individual soul to the absolute it takes only in a figurative sense it's not like a cab or of you know like uber or something you happen to take me to Brahman it's not like that you realize that you are prominent so these are the three meanings which destroys your ignorance which loosens the bondages of suffering and which takes you to to brahman or makes you realize that you are promised so that's the meaning of open assured you approach this teaching which you have congratulations you are here and nee this is what we have to do over the by the way it's going to take time not too much time maybe one year a little more than that to study this if you think that's a lot I remember once this teaching started in in um koresh world one Swami was teaching I was not dead but I heard the recordings very scratchy old tape recordings and somebody asked how long is this going to take because they were studying not only mandu coupon easier than demand o'ciock Erica but also the commentary of Shankar Acharya and there is a sub commentary on the commentary by Ananda giddy so it's a big thing long text how long is this going to take and the Swami said oh it's not a question of time as long as you're breathing the open naman Duke is going to continue as long as you as you are living and tax was chilly as long as the breath flows you're going to come to class so I'm not asking for so much hey give me here a little more than a year all right so open eyes shut also an additional remark this is the path of knowledge we will continuously hear the truth again and again think about it and meditate upon it but also at the same time an important caution which I will repeat some times do not neglect other practices what's the position on meditation the Manduca will say it's a good idea you want to meditate meditate what's the position on devotion love of God not bad don't do that yes and good works serving others yeah good do that and moral life very important you must have a modern ethical life moral and ethical life unselfish work devotion to God in whichever farm you you appreciate you you you your tradition tells you to do and meditation all these are good supporting practices should not be abandoned if you abandon them you are in trouble there's there's always the temptation as you go along Mundaka Upanishad I remember one senior Swami coming to our monastic training center in Ballard mud and asking what are you teaching the boys that means the young monks so the teacher said we are studying the Mundaka Upanishad swami ñamandu' kia god forbid they'll be turned into eight East's from nastic whether they'll be turned into eight atheist so the danger is there please don't become atheists also the two extremes one is skepticism give it time it will sink in it will begin to make sense the other other end is over enthusiasm and the people walk around with the noses in the air what happened to you I studied them and okay now the people generally tend to develop a superiority complex after this because you feel that we have got the truth and the rest of you people who who believe in this religion or that religion or people who don't believe in religion and 80s and materialists all the rest seem like pygmies after this because you you you can clearly see where each person is or stuck so don't be judgemental don't don't be so period don't go to the other extreme of looking down on others all right so let's take a look at the man Duke Upanishads what does it contain now we are in the first chapter of the Mundaka Upanishad by the way any such text starts with what is caught what I call the four preliminaries it's not mentioned here Shankaracharya and his commentary just touches upon it in once once one and a half sentences in other books it will go on and on you know you remember the qualified aspirant who is qualified to study Vedanta what is the subject-matter of Atlanta what is the purpose of studying Vedanta and what is the connection between the text and the purpose of studying Vedanta what are the four preliminaries in Sanskrit Anu bondage Atocha tire four preliminaries for prelims what are the four preliminaries the qualified student qualifications then subject matter then benefit and then for relation I'm just mentioning by the way because one should discuss these before starting a text anyway than to text it will take one or two classes to discuss these things but here Shankar Acharya says whatever are the preliminaries for all other ways anta texts are the same preliminaries for this text and let's go ahead with the text so he doesn't talk about it much what are the qualifications we know the fourfold qualifications these are four preliminaries and fourfold qualification that's different don't get them confused the fourfold qualifications we know are Vivica our discrimination between the eternal and the non eternal that there is some eternal reality to pursue what religion spirituality Vedanta whatever they say there is a trick to this and the world is non eternal first one Viveca discrimination or separation between the two we all have it to some extent on the other otherwise we wouldn't be here why would you waste a nice afternoon on in the middle of the way a work day if you do not feel there's something worthwhile here second wear our gear this this passion for the non-eternal for all that we have been trying to do and get happiness in life in different ways you know through relationships through money through name and fame through success through health through beauty all of that this passion that that really does not get me what I want and true and deep happiness is possible through spirituality so Vairagya the second the third one is a set of six and this is getting complicated for limbs and then for qualifications and the set of six so set of six are Shama or quite mind if I had that Swami I wouldn't be here that's what I'm here for true but to some extent the mind must be quite there for this higher pursuit no higher pursuit is there in human civilization today I'm telling that with I mean might sound grandiose I haven't found anything greater than this man Tokyo pani should ever in all the study I've done of the literal literary philosophical religious scriptures of the world there's nothing higher than this this is the final word are there higher texts than the Manduca finishes yes actually there are this for example the ashtavakra there is for example the other do the gita but you can't learn Advaita from them they are not meant for learning you know you are already you know advaitha you are convinced about it those texts just keep on hammering the one thing again and again and again then meant to fall meditation and calming your mind and settling down on the truth that you are Brahman and nothing else that's all those texts go on telling you that so the the final word in one sense is this beyond this it's just other text just keep on repeating the same thing in a very grand and wonderful way of course so peaceful mind is required then damaja namaha means control of these sense organs and motor organs too much I want to see this I want to see that I want to taste this and I'm a foodie I am a I have a travel bug I have a and the your study of Vedanta will be episodic and disturbed and little control of the sense organs and motor organs then the third one is detection a spiritual fortitude bearing with the troubles that life throws at you and that occasional bout of flu that that was sudden you know somebody insults you and you don't feel good I don't worry I don't want to go to the class today I feel really bad and down those kinds of problems physical problems financial problems weather problems a little fortitude put up with that I will go to class no matter what that kind of fortitude detection and then the fourth one is opera tea we draw from sensory pleasure seeking if I'm engaged in partying all night and next afternoon going to Vedanta class you'll get a hangover you you won't be able to concentrate on Vedanta so operati or withdrawal from too much chasing sense pleasures operative rarity means enjoyment of sense pleasure operative reversing it not completely but to the extent that that it leaves you a little free a little calm and relaxed so that and little clear in mind so that you can concentrate operati and then yes Dhamma is control of the sense organs Dhamma is control sense organs so that but operati is this general principle of not seeking pleasure and satisfaction in the world you know the the idea of drown my sorrows in drink don't drown your sorrows in drink drown your sorrows in Vedanta so that is operatic don't think of what don't make it a policy that the world will give me pleasure that's rotting and reversing that approach is operating then Samad hana a settled death once I have pulled pulled back from the world yes once I pulled back from the world don't don't slide back into the world again pull back means too much engagement with the world too much it's pleasure-seeking in the world don't slide back into it again Samad Hannah means settled ness settled ness in Vedanta settle Ignace in your meditation settled ness in your spiritual practice Samana basically means means focus and then the last of the six remember where we are yes no Samad Hana is equanimity it's a settled 'no sin in your Vedantic pursuit a focus concentration so and the last one is Shraddha remember the last of the six four and here there are four and among these four there are six so don't get confused for preliminaries the first of the preliminaries is the qualifications and in the qualifications there are four qualifications among the four qualifications the third one is this set of six disciplines and the six disciplines and last one is Shanta yes yes the four qualifications are called sadhana thirsty and the fourfold qualifications for spiritual practice the sixth one is shut down a firm faith in the teachings of the teacher and the scriptures a firm faith means I don't get it now but if I persevere I'll get it it's not not a call to believe I mean I'm as you to believe without using your rational faculties it's just enough like a working hypothesis that what they are saying is true I don't get it yet but I'll get it if I perceive it I'll get it I'll realize it's like when you sign up for a course in the university you don't sign up and the first thing you do you don't say that the the teacher is a liar and the books are full of fake news fake news yes no if you start with that you'll never make any progress how do we start a course if I start a course in a good university I'll start with the feeling the teacher knows what he or she is talking about the books are all right let me apply myself and I'll get it eventually that's how we earn anybody reasonably approaches any kind of study that's all that is required it's not a you have to believe kind of thing in fact you must not believe you must understand ultimately understanding is what is record required Shradha and then you come to the fourth one I hope you are thoroughly confused by or by all of this for ten six and for the the fourth of the sudden gesture which is mu MOOC short one in intense desire to be free read our problem is we don't even feel the bondage let alone desire to be free there okay once in a while we are miserable that's all we we come up bang against the the bars of the cage and we feel miserable but otherwise we are happy with indicate we have made a life for ourselves so intense desire to be free mu mu Krypton these are the qualifications for the student it's the first what's the next preliminary subject matter what is the subject matter Brum mahatmyam i am brandon that is to be realized this I discussed a little earlier I think I am this little creature but I am Brahman I am one with the divine my real nature is the absolute that I have to realize that's the subject matter that's what the open ashati ch's what is the benefit the benefit what's the purpose of all of this the purpose is elimination of suffering and attainment of joy in sanskrit authentica the kana pretty complete total elimination of suffering overcoming of suffering total overcoming of suffering and param anand the property attainment of ultimate bliss you see once you I mean in India this time pointed out one very big problem in spiritual life is we don't believe it's possible we believe it's possible to be a multi-millionaire so we worked very hard we believe it's possible to be a PhD so we work very hard we believe this is possible and that is possible we believe it is possible to go to the moon and so the country worked so hard to put put men on the moon but we don't believe this is possible that's why we don't take it up seriously so this benefit is that overcoming of suffering and attainment of permanent and deep real joy that is basically the purpose of our life let's put in another way in generally in Indian philosophy that we are we are in the cycle of births and deaths and we are suffering they are being whirled around on this merry-go-round of maya and how do you get off this ride so getting freedom from the cycle of births and deaths that's normally how it is put traditionally in india but but today somebody might say I don't believe in this cycle of births and deaths I don't know I've got only this this particular life so yes a deeper understanding would be overcoming suffering and attainment of bliss that I think everybody will find acceptable because that's what everybody is trying to do anyway Shankar Acharya in his commentary here he puts it in another way he says rogue artists yoga never ET Avis West tada that means just as a sick person the medicine and the doctor removes the sickness the medicine and the doctor does not give him health medicine and the doctor removes the sickness and his natural state is health in the same way what does the open he should do our suffering is caused by this samsara and the nature of this samsara is duality in this Upanishad will remove duality dueto add weight of harvey ava player genome he does not mince words the whole benefit of this is add weight of harbour non duality we attain non duality I am this one non dual reality which is Brahman which is also this multi various universe so the ground of multiplicity the ground of duality is non duality the reality of behind this duality is non duality and I am that non dual reality this is what the Upanishad is going to give us Shankar Acharya says and is interesting the word for health in sanskrit and many indian languages is SWA SWA it literally means being established in the self Schwester means established in the self and finally the fourth one relation this is a technical point the question is you are talking about knowledge of the self I am Brahman but what you are studying is a book so what is the relationship between the book and knowledge of the self the relationship is they say both diabolica one teaches you about the other one informs you about the other so the text will teach us about our real self which is the non-dual brahman and repeat what what relationship i'll be talking about when you talk about a relationship it always has to be between at least two things so what are the two things they are talking about the knowledge of brahman and the text which you have got in your hands what's the connection the text will tell you about your real nature that's all both diabolica the thing to be understood is I am Brahman that which will make me understand is the book in your hands so that's the relationship so these are technical it is anyway four preliminaries I have gone in detail in in in to them at least a little bit Shankar Acharya just dispenses with it in one sentence all right okay we have time and good because we haven't started yet now what is the Upanishad about what does it do actually the Upanishad has twelve mantras and it undertakes two kinds of enquiry two kinds of enquiry Atma vichara ohm god of each other an inquiry into the Atman into your self the self as you would expect what am I an inquiry into that because the they will ultimately show us that you are that we are Brahman and inquiry into that and the second one interestingly is an inquiry into the mantra oh so the Upanishad does two things ohm inquiry and self inquiry should it be the he enquiry or I I can never make a do tonight okay fine now I put the ohm before because actually it starts with the ohm inquiry what is the ohm inquiry and how is it related and what's the point the self inquiry we understand because if you are going to realize I am Brahman we need to inquire into ourselves because what we think of ourselves right now and what the open each other is going to teach us it will be done through inquiry but what where does this omen quality come in the first mantra is about the ohm inquiry and the second mantra is about the self inquiry the first mantra which we will do just now is about ohm inquiry and the second mantra is about the self inquiry and then the self inquiry is developed further in the mantras three four five six and seven so the self inquiry is complete at the seventh mantra whereas in the ohm inquiry it starts with the first mantra and after the self inquiry is complete we come back to the home inquiry in the eighth ninth tenth eleventh and twelfth mantras The Omen Kritika is completed in the twelfth mantra so twelve mantras in demand ochio punish it man Duke Upanishad finished that's all that's all that there is to it now what is going on here okay let me the self inquiry one technique is given entire Mundaka Upanishad depend on wonderful arica also is dependent on one technique technique of what of revealing to us that we are prominent there are different techniques in Vedanta we know of the technique of punch Akash are the five layers you know the Annamayya prana miami no mayo big annamaya are under Maya five layers of the human personality leading to the real self we have studied the drink drishya Vivica the different techniques this has the technique of the three states waking dreaming and sleeping waking dreaming and sleeping so the self enquiry will be based on a close look at our experiences of waking dreaming and sleeping I often say there are different approaches to religion the most common approach to religion is the bhakti approach devotional approach you are told that God exists how do I know believe it then what do I do then worship God we will tell you prayers and rituals by which you will believe in God and worship God and love God and adore God and serve God with the ultimate goal that God will reveal himself herself itself to you and you'll be blessed attain salvation it's basically based on belief you started belief and that's the general understanding of religion look at the word used for religion in this country faith faith what's your faith as we will see in the Manduca nothing could be further Manduca is not a faith it's almost just the opposite so the first one approach the broadest approach most common approach to religion is faith based another way of approaching religion is not believing this or that but experiencing it Vivekananda came to this country more than 100 years ago and he said religion is realization not believing in this or that but realization if God exists I must see God if I have an immortal soul I must know it so realization how the the Patanjali yoga yoga techniques in in Patanjali yoga they will give you a set of exercises techniques sit in this way breathe in that way visualize in this way meditate in the other way and so and so forth and you will have a series of extraordinary experiences you'll have a series of extraordinary experiences some oddities which will prove to you the truth of religion do you see the difference between the first approach in the second approach the first approach is you believe and whatever will happen will depend on this card you believe in the second approach is it don't start with belief you start with practice technique and XP you trying to gain experience what experiences extraordinary XP not our day-to-day experiences extraordinary yogic experiences which will reveal the truth of religion to you that's the yogic approach second approach the approach taken here is yet a different approach the approach in Advaita is not faith we're on your starting with faith you are not even looking for extraordinary experiences here is the beauty of Advaita you are only taking up experiences which are available to everybody do you wake are you awake do you dream do you sleep good enough you're qualified form and occupations so the common experiences of day to day life if you have those experience will have it what way Manduca will do what we Dante does is it takes us by the hand and shows us the secret hidden here that's why the the realization here is in advaitha it's often called the open secret in fact swami awakened to gave a lecture called the open secret the open secret means it's hidden it's a secret and yet it's hidden in plain sight one teacher said it's like your nose it's right here if you're looking straight ahead actually you can't see it you need to be taught how to see there's a particular way of seeing your nose so it's right there the truth is right with us but it just needs to be seen and we need to be taught how to see it so is always available truth continuously available truth I say god is in front of us is literally doing this and we don't know where is God so it's closer than the closest to see this most obvious of truths what we Dante does is it uses our always available experiences waking dreaming sleeping what could be simpler than that it does not even demand of you you will have extraordinary yogic experiences no no no no so that's what the opening shots do and the self inquiry here takes up waking dreaming sleeping these these experiences these are this is called our start TRAI which are the inquiry into the three states of a star trial our star trailer which are what are the three states waking dreaming sleeping it's not an invitation to go to sleep you remember waking experience most important why is this vedantins are a peculiar lot is a waking experience is very very important why because it enables you to study Vedanta that's why waking is important it doesn't say it enables me to earn money my living and enables me to have a family and and go about my business of life all that is unimportant for Vedanta it and enables you to come to the Manduca class and that's the only importance of the way waking state in fact yes one of the Swami's in Uttarakhand said and tell you in Hindi and translate into English geography Naruto hulky full keihan sushupti here see I was tired you see waking and dreaming these are light states these are superficial states deep sleep now that's the state he's not joking he says then not that he's asking you to go into deep sleep but he says an inquiry into deep sleep is very very interesting all right so what how is it related to ohm now ohm the sound ohm ohm is is the problem probably the mahalia stay entre in all of Hinduism in all of Buddhism in all of Sikhism in Jainism in all the Indian religions Oh miss o all-pervading whether they're doing lists are non dualist whether they believe in God do not believe in God whether they're Hindus or not Hindus or whom is common to all of them so there was even a Time magazine cover on ohm that on the popularity of meditation techniques now the sound ohm is produced like this if I if I make a sound with my lips open and then I proceed to close my lips gently till they're completely closed you will generate ohm watch this or listen to this [Music] try it don't be shy right it's the same effort the same sound it changes from a to two as you close your lips the entire range is generated from the opening of the mouth to the closing of the mouth to the sealing of the lips oh so the ohm is actually oh but the rules of sanskrit grammar say you can't pronounce it um oh and ooh together they make oh so together it's o therefore the correct pronunciation is ohm the correct pronunciation is not um so when you pronounce it oh you're doing it right but basically you see it we go through our um so this is the mantra oh yes the question is does it correspond to the three states yes but before that let me add very quickly something which will we will discuss in detail later on you will just see now the Upanishad will say ohm is all of this is everything the universe is ohm let's read the first mantra let's get started so you'll at least have the satisfaction of in the first class we did something we started the first mantra the first mantra as you will see is begins the ohm inquiry first one and then we will abandon it we will go into the self inquiry and this will take some time we will finish that and then come back and complete the ohm enquiry the first mantra says are you alright please repeat after me the first mantra Oh mediated aksaram own it dated action items are ovum legumes are ovum the scope of Jahannam - yo pop jahannum butum bava bava shot butum Brava Brava it is a rhythm ankara Eva yet Chandrakala tetum turn up young God Eva shut up young God Eva what does it mean this mantra this letter ohm Akshara here means the letter this letter ohm is indeed all this all this means the entire universe whatever we experienced an explanation of this a clear explanation of this begins now now means in this Upanishad what I just said all means all this a clear explanation of this begins now all this means what butum that all that exists now from here to the farthest galaxy bravas yet what is going to exist in future Robert means that which exists buta means that which was past all that existed in the past whatever existed from the beginning of the universe in the past and even before the beginning of the universe all that existed in the past everything that exists now and everything that what whatsoever is going to exist in the future all of it is Oh sarvam own car ever all of it is ohm only nothing other than ohm and that which is beyond the three three times past present and future that which transcends time that reality is also oh whatever is within time which means within Maya is oh that which is beyond time is also all what is beyond time near guna Brahman and Brahman plus Maya that is saguna brahman that is beyond time that's also ohm the name of the ultimate reality Brahman is ohm and and everything that we see manifested here all around that is home that's been said here what it means we will discover slowly before I go into the final phase of this class which will be the final phase of every class it will be a meditation on ohm let me just quickly add and let me just quickly elucidate here or just indicate here what's meant by this what do you mean everything is old always a word like if I say book book is a word it that word book is not even this thing it's a thing it's quite apart from the word book right it's just one word and one thing how can one word ohm be everything in the universe well like this ohm is the substratum of all names did you see that all the sounds the range of sounds is covered when we make home from opening the lips to slowly closing it and completely closing it [Music] so all the sounds that you can generate with different positions of the lips and the tongue that's how we generate different sounds so all sounds the matrix the basis of all sounds is ohm are you with me on this because our our range of producing sounds is is from the open lips to the closed lips and of course various manipulations of the tongue within our mouth so all sounds are contained within ohm all sounds are manifestations of ohm and all names are combinations of those sounds and repeat all sounds are generated from the basis of home and all names are what are just combinations of sounds book pen flower these are combinations of sounds and all the sounds are generated from ohm now these names correspond to different things in the universe right these names correspond to different things in the universe all the different things in the universe are just names and forms superimposed upon one existence Brahman Brahman existence consciousness place plus various forms are this universe what is this universe of tables and chairs men and women and stars and quasars and quarks all of them are names and forms of one reality called Brahman that's what I'll do it away Dante wants to say remember we're not we have not proved all this this is that this is the claim so the entire universe our various names and forms it all reduces to one reality called Brahman his own Brahman alone appears as all of this this universe and all the things in the universe have names and all the names are nothing other than appearances of ohm so all names are appearances of ohm all forms and appearances of Brahman they correspond to each other the names correspond to forms in that sense o means all of this are you with me I'll repeat all names are generated from sounds all sounds originated from ohm okay you know in what sense all forms are basically nothing other than Brahmin with a net of Maya with them this entire universe according to Vedanta there is only such ad Ananda and everything else is a form superimposed by Maya such Eden and the Brahmin alone is appearing in all these forms so these forms and names that are they correspond to each other and ohm is the source of all names Brahman is the source of all forms own is also the name of Brahman in yoga Sutra it says the seer Huachuca trinova the name of the absolute if it can give it a name at all is ohm so everything that is within time has names and all names originated from ohm so the all names are nothing other than ohm in that sense ohm is everything and that which is beyond time Brahman the name of Brahman is also ohm so ohm is also that which is beyond time this is the meaning and it's not the correct meaning yes because it just said everything that is past present and future is ohm you understand that part how how is everything that is past present and future that is ohm yeah because everything that is in the universe past present and future they are all different forms of Brahman none other than Brahman they all have names they all have names they are expressed by names names are nothing other than combinations of sounds sounds are all manifestations of oh we literally saw how we speak ohm so everything all names are not nothing other than ohm and the things denoted by those names are what exists in past present and future but what exists beyond past present and future beyond time Brahman exists beyond time Maya exists beyond time that is also ohm because openly should say and the Yoga Sutras say the name of the ultimate the name of God is ohm so o means not only all that is within time ohm is that which is beyond time also and I just said this is not the correct meaning there is a deeper meaning but Allen have to nail it it did not say that ohm is the name of all that exists did you notice what it said it said ohm is all that exists past present and future how can a word be all that exists in past present and future no time for that now it requires a deep investigation which maybe next time I'll tell you but now let's go to the last phase of the class why is all me included here you see the self inquiry should be enough to reveal to us I am Brahman and indeed it is enough but ohm the ohm inquiries is introduced here as a support as a help as a practice as a technique and that support help or practice we will use simple experience waking dreaming and sleeping you know Rahman ma she once said somebody asked him maybe after studying Vedanta that you have you need all these qualifications to study Vedanta somebody is scared and went to Ramana Maharshi and asked am I qualified to study Vedanta am I qualified for enlightenment and Ramana Maharshi said did you say I I qualified yes then you are qualified if you say ah you're qualified to ask Who am I if you use the term I you're qualified to ask Who am I in the same way if you if you if you are awake if you dream if you sleep you can perfectly follow this method and to help you along the way this all men choir is included as a support as a technique what does it say this our uma a you M remember this is not a it is a the Sanskrit and this is ooh and this is mah Oh now connect the are to the waking connect means in your mind make a link and just as you decide to call this thing a pen and this thing a shirt and this thing a mic in the same way called the waking world and you the Waker this body and yourself as The Vicar and your waking life all of it the knower and the known in that an entire pair of acre and the wakers world call it all and who related to dreaming the dreamer and his or her dream the dream world and MA connected to deep sleep the blankness this I will not even say the sleeper and the deep sleep world because sleeper in the deep sleep world are all merged in one darkness you don't have an experience of I am in deep sleep now in dream at least you have an experience something is going on and waking of course you have an experience something is going on connected ah when you say or think about it waking and baking world my life here when you slide into the ooh my dreams whatever kind of dreams I have ai ai ai and dreaming in a world that is ooh as you slide and conclude with mmm that is the deep sleep Blanc nothing and the one consciousness the one consciousness which experiences the waking dreaming and deep sleep it's it's not connected it's not limited to the waking you are the same one who was awake you're the same one who was dreaming you're the same one who had experience of deep sleep these not states of consciousness these are states of the mind these are states of the mind so this this one is called the fourth the Turia why fourth you the Waker you are done you are first you as the dreamer you are second you as the deep sleeper you a third but you as the consciousness which experienced all of them this remember this fourth one alone this consciousness alone in the waking state becomes the Waker this consciousness alone you the consciousness alone in the dream state you are the dreamer this consciousness is alone experiencing the blankness of deep sleep you are called a sleeper one two and three are different forms or dresses that this consciousness puts on this so this fourth the Sanskrit word for the fourth is to hear this word you come across in in gold apothecary cos so I am the fourth the whole trick in Vedanta is that I think of myself as the one as the Waker Here I am sitting in bed on to class trying to learn Vedanta here this is me vedanta says if this is not really you the real you is hidden behind the Waker as this fourth consciousness this is the real consciousness it's like a person who opens the door of her shop and transacts business sells and buys and then shuts the shutters and goes into the another room and what opens the TV and watches a TV then switches up the TV and retires into a third room and tucks himself into bed the first one is the wakers who transact with the world through the doors of the senses shuts down the shutters of the senses and goes to sleep and dreams that's like watching TV and then switches of the TV deep sleep but whether it's in the first room and a conducting business are relaxing in the second room and watching TV or sleeping in the third room it's the same man the shopkeeper and the TV watcher and the sleeper in the third room there are all three appearances of one person that one person is the reality our in our ignorance we consider this waking individual to be the reality here I am I am real and this world is real these problems are my problems they all disappear when you go into the Dreaming and all the good and bad things in the dream so nice dreams and the the nightmares they all disappear when everything merges in the darkness of deep sleep who's the one experiencing all of them that fourth that's the silence after oh when you say Oh [Music] that silence expresses the fort the or expresses the waking the who expresses the dreamer the mmmm expresses deep sleep and the deep sleeper and the silence after that expresses the one reality remember this silence isn't crucial this silence underlies the room this silence is a part then all the three have seized the ER has merged into the Oh has merged into the moon and the mem merges into the silence all three have seized the silence continues and when all three are there that's the trick the silence is underneath that also similarly that that fourth the pure consciousness the Atman Victoria is right here only it has put on the dress of the Waker now when you go to sleep tonight and dream it will put on the dress of the sleeper above the dreamer when you merge into deep sleep that fourth consciousness alone will the fourth one will only put on the dress of the deep sleeper okay I will end with a short meditation this is something that will repeat every time just a few minutes there's always the urge to tell everything at once which is a bad idea all right the meditation is very simple I will repeat ohm three times at a stretch and you don't repeat it you just listen to the ohm and think with your eyes closed and sitting relaxed you just think when the oh is coming you think of the waking world your life your body mind this person you are as it merges into the ooh it will be one continuous oh imagine it mirth merging into the dream state your dreams you don't have to remember any particular dream just generic dreaming and how the whole baking world is gone how the Waker is gone and it says some kind of a vague dream that's going on and then that merges into the blankness of deep sleep there is no no er there's no known it's oneness blank and beyond that in the silence drop the waking and the vehicle drop the dreaming and the dreamer drop the deep sleep and the deep sleeper what is there I will repeat thrice then you will continue to do it by yourself just for a few minutes and then I we will all chant ohm three times together and you come out of it so first three times I will chant and you try to connect it to waking dreaming deep sleep and most importantly beyond okay [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] we will chant own together three times [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Music] now if you like you can open your eyes any quick questions observations yes yes correct Turia is not separate not even a state waking is a state dreaming is a state deep sleep is a state and there are states of the mind Turia is not a state it is the reality itself it is consciousness itself in it the states appear exist play and disappear Turia is the reality it's its consciousness itself also as you said it's not separate rather waking dreaming and deep sleep are not separate from Toria it is because of Toria that the waking world is illumined because of consciousness we are able to experience this it is because of Toria that you're able to experience dreams it's because of Toria that you're able to experience the blankness the absence of waking and dreaming they all rotate in the light of Toria Toria exists by itself independently of all of them they exist dependent on Toria yes Toria literally means the four yes the meditative state will be of some variety of the deep sleep state the deepest meditative States so Toria is not a meditative state look at the language you state the state must be a state of the mind scattered mind meditative mind waking mind sleeping mind dreaming mind and obviously the EEG readouts of all of them will be different but Toria shines unaffected nevertheless that's what you are will see there are many more interesting things to come lots and lots it's that we're unpacking a treasure chest their language breaks down now do you experience Turia not quite so is it just a theory not at all in fact Toria is the basis of all experience Turia is the basis of all experience what is experience if I ask you experience is nothing other than this consciousness being channeled through the mind and the senses and then you see this I am experiencing a pen now what's happening here is the pen and light is being reflected of it going into my eyes exciting than the the neurons there they're sending impulses to the brain somehow an image of this pen is can conveyed to the mind I'm saying somehow because at that point our knowledge breaks down more than scientific knowledge some art conveyed to the mind in the mind of Rick Lee a movement of the mind of the form of the pen is generated and that shines in the light of consciousness which is Turia that's an experience of the pen it takes a long time to state it it happens in an instant every experience is is happening in the light of consciousness now consciousness itself is the basis of all experience is it an experience it's not an experience in itself is rather the enabler of all experience and it's you so is it beyond experience in one sense yes it cannot be objectified in an experience in another sense no because it's really you it's what you are it's what I am actually so one Swami put it this way mon Dieu Cay Upanishad does not seek to give you a new experience it seeks to reveal to you the significance of any experience all experiences actually point back towards tutorial it's happening in it's like this light light every object in the room every object that you experience in the room is because of that light in one sense everything you experience in this room everything you see in this room is pointing you back towards that light it's telling you about the existence of that light so you are that light yes yes and the same Turia is just the word used here for Atma bhooteriya means fourth why fourth Waker is first dreamer is second deep sleeper is third and Turia will be the fourth why it is one two three four because the moment self-inquiry will start we'll see in the next class how does the self inquiry proceed the Upanishad will say the self has four aspects first second third and fourth the first three aspects are appearances false the fourth aspect is the reality that's what it will say say what are the first three aspects waker dreamer deep sleeper they are not real they are not real in the sense they are not the ultimate reality the shopkeeper is not the ultimate reality the TV watcher is not the ultimate reality the example which I gave the deeps that's one in his pajamas sleeping in bed is not the ultimate reality the person is the reality who is doing all these things in the same way it is that one consciousness who cycles through all of these which is the ultimate reality okay last one yes benefit correct that's the noblest aspiration no matter what it does does it make me unhappy or happy or whatever it is if I need to know what's going on here nothing better than Mundaka Upanishad it reveals the truth about you it reveals the truth about the universe I said an inquiry into everything is equal to the inquiry into Brahman is equal to an inquiry into the self once you realize what I am truly the studium you realize that the secret behind the entire universe in one in one sense I'm not again he will not become a scientific dictionary but you will realize the reality of everything you come to a state was one mistake put it very beautifully once you realize this you find something within yourself which cannot be improved nothing that you can add to it will make it better there is nothing that you can take away from it which will make it worse in Gita puts it in other words young loved wad getting which nothing greater remains to be got in life established in which the greatest of Sorrows cannot cannot shake you this means theta Duquesne a guru nabina which all deity by the heaviest of sorrows you will remain unshaken where are the sorrows you the sorrows are located in your waking state in your dream state in a deep sleep also there is no sorrow I often say the sickest person the worst part of in a state in Owens mom saya in the MV the intensive care unit of Mount Sinai who is going to maybe pass away real he's going to die in tomorrow day after tomorrow worst case that's also something that's happening in his waking state the moment that guy goes into a dream state that thing is gone or at least into the deep sleep State everything is gone and none of these states are actually in the torria they are all play of datoria the Turia appears shines forth in all of these ways many many things are there to be said stories and wonderful ideas very startling insights all over the next year where the blessings of chuckle mind Swami checking yes chant a shanty shanti he hurry he own that's at sri ramakrishna aparna must [Music]\n"
